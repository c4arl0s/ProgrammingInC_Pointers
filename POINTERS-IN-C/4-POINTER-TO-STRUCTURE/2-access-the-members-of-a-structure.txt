We know that to access a member of a structure we use the . operator.

In the following example we are accessing the members of the student structure.

printf("ID: %s\n", std.id);
printf("First Name: %s\n", std.firstname);
printf("Last Name: %s\n", std.lastname);
printf("Points: %f\n", std.points);
