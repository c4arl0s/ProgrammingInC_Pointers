I like this "real world" code example of pointer to pointer usage, in Git 2.0, commit 7b1004b:

Linus once said:

I actually wish more people understood the really core low-level kind of coding. Not big, complex stuff like the lockless name lookup, but simply good use of pointers-to-pointers etc.

For example, I've seen too many people who delete a singly-linked list entry by keeping track of the "prev" entry, and then to delete the entry, doing something like
if (prev)
  prev->next = entry->next;
else
  list_head = entry->next;

and whenever I see code like that, I just go "This person doesn't understand pointers". And it's sadly quite common.
People who understand pointers just use a "pointer to the entry pointer", and initialize that with the address of the list_head. And then as they traverse the list, they can remove the entry without using any conditionals, by just doing a
*pp =  entry->next

Carlos Santiago: I don't know why is a list at this point of my knowledge.
